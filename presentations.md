# Presentations

Each presentation will be at most 5 minutes long. We recommend that you to plan your presentation ahead of time and to practice running through it at least once. 2 minutes will then be allotted for questions from the class. (For a total of 7 minutes). We suggest the following structure:

#### Introduction

- What's your app called?
- Why is it useful? What is your "pitch"?

#### Demonstrating Your App

- What are the integral features of your app?

#### Demonstrating Your Code

- What was the most difficult part?
- What did you learn?
- What are you most proud of?

#### The Planning Process

- How did you arrive at this idea?
- How did you decide who would have which responsibilities?
- What would you change about your planning process?

#### The Week

- What was your week like?  
- Did you feel the Emotional Cycle of Change?
- How did you work together?

#### Highs and Lows

- What worked well?
